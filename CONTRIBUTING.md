We'd love to have you help make this a better platform for all. One of the things that we're striving to do is to make this platform as flexible as possible for everyone. 

First on our todo list is to improve documentation and test edge-cases. If you would like to help with that, awesome! If you have other ideas, great! 

We're by far not terraform experts and we want to take on the support of the community to make this better. 

If you have an idea on what you'd like to work on, please open an issue and let us know what you'd be interested in working on.

From there, the process would look like this:

- New branch created for issue
- Fork code to your own repo
- Make a branch for changes
- Create a PR from `your_fork/branch` to the branch for your isssue
- We'll review the code and test it to ensure it works and solves the problem
- Merge to `main`
